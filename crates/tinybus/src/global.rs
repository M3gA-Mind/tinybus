//! Process-wide singletons: one bus, one native registry, initialised once.
//!
//! A host application has exactly one bus, and every domain in it needs to
//! reach that bus from code that was not handed a reference — a `publish` deep
//! inside a scheduler, a handler registered from a `Once::call_once`. That is
//! what this provides, and it is why OpenHuman's bus was a singleton before any
//! of this existed.
//!
//! # Why the host declares the static, not tinybus
//!
//! The bus is generic over the host's event type, so tinybus cannot own a
//! `static` of it — there is no single type to name. Instead the host writes:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! static BUS: tinybus::global::OnceBus<DomainEvent> = tinybus::global::OnceBus::new();
//! ```
//!
//! …and gets the whole surface off it. `OnceBus::new` is `const`, so this costs
//! nothing until something initialises it.
//!
//! # Before initialisation
//!
//! Every accessor is safe to call before `init`. Publishing goes nowhere and
//! logs at `trace`; subscribing returns `None`. This is deliberate and carried
//! over from the bus being replaced: a domain that publishes during early
//! startup, or inside a unit test that never stood a bus up, must not panic.
//! The cost is that a genuinely missing `init` is quiet — which is what
//! [`OnceBus::is_initialised`] and the startup log line are for.
