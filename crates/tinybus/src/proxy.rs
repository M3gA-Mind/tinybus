//! The client side: a typed handle to one interface on one remote object.
//!
//! This is the entire surface the OpenHuman kernel is meant to depend on. A
//! kernel that used to link `whisper-rs`, `cpal` and a model runtime to
//! transcribe audio now does this:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn example(connection: tinybus::Connection) -> tinybus::Result<()> {
//! let voice = connection.proxy(
//!     "ai.tinyhumans.openhuman.Voice",
//!     "/ai/tinyhumans/openhuman/Voice",
//!     "ai.tinyhumans.openhuman.Voice",
//! )?;
//! let transcript: String = voice.call("Transcribe", ("/tmp/clip.wav",)).await?;
//! # let _ = transcript;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! …and links `serde`. The type parameters do the work the removed dependency
//! used to: `R` is checked against what actually came back, so a service that
//! changes its return shape fails at the caller with a deserialize error naming
//! the mismatch, rather than silently producing a default.
